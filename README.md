Code and Sound database for speech signal processing

Main code is [adapSpecOver.m](MATLAB/adapSpecOver.m)
Psychoacoustic modelling and calculation of the oversubstraction parameter and the noise floor is done in the functions [speech_enhancement.m](MATLAB/speech_enhancement.m) and [noise_mask.m](MATLAB/speech_enhancement.m)

The papers referred for a different codes are mentioned in the comments along with the numbers.
Refer to the [folder](Speech Signal Processing Paper/) of Speech Signal Processing paper for getting access to the relevant papers.
