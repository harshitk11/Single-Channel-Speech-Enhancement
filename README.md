# Single-Channel Speech Enhancement
Speech enhancement algorithm inspired by the human auditory system to remove background noise in audio signals. A detailed report of the entire code base can be found [here](Report.docx).

## Usage
Main code is [adapSpecOver.m](MATLAB/adapSpecOver.m)
Psychoacoustic modelling and calculation of the oversubstraction parameter and the noise floor is done in the functions [speech_enhancement.m](MATLAB/speech_enhancement.m) and [noise_mask.m](MATLAB/speech_enhancement.m)
